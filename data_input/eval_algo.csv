"SVD","Slow training speed, less reliable, and high error",7,2,3,2
"Popular","Despite the speed, not really reliable. Also it has a terrible accuracy",8,5,2,1
"Funk SVD","Similar to SVD, just having a slightly better accuracy",8,2,3,3
"Random","Despite being very fast and having low error, recommending random items will not convince anyone",11,5,1,5
"IBCF","Very reliable, decent accuracy, but very slow to train",11,2,5,4
"UBCF","IBCF counterparts, but being much faster to converge making it a better algorithm",13,4,5,4
"Matrix Factorization","With the decent speed and incredible accuracy, combined with the reassuring concept, Matrix Factorization alongside deep learning is the most ideal recommender system algorithm nowadays",15,5,5,5
